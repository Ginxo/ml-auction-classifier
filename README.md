# Machine Learning Technical Articles Classifier
It's a simple machine learning articles classifier. The idea is:

* Training the model
  * Download the tech articles
  * Process this information with NLP (features)
  * Dataset: Represent each article in a vector of 20 most important words
  * Distance: the number of words they have in common
* Running the model (unsupervised)
  * Problem instances: Get articles from other sources and process them
  * Labels: Tech or non-tech
