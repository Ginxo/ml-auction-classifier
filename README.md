# Machine Learning Technical Articles Classifier
It's a simple machine learning articles classifier. The idea is:

* Generating the dataset
  * Download the tech articles
  * Process this information with NLP (features)
  * Dataset: Represent each article in a vector of 20 most important words
  * Distance: the number of words they have in common

* Running a prediction using three different algorithms
  * Unsupervised
    * K-Nearest Neighbors
    * Naive bayes
  * Supervised
    * K-Means
